# castles or goblins

A game to make games with friends.

- As a user with a player, i can give the player to another user
  * ....
- As a DM, I can launch a game when users have joined and created players.
- As a DM, I can create spaces for adventures, filled with objects and creatures
- As a player, I can choose what to do in that spaces
- As a DM, I can transform players' wishes into gameplays
- As a user, I can access my private Dashboard (lobby perso)
