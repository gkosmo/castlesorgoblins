# castles or goblins

A game to make games with friends.

The idea is to make a platform for role-playing games with masters of the game and players writing out their actions and letting a structured fate deal wither they succeed.

- As a user, I can subscribe to the platform
- As a subscribed user, I can create a game 

    DM = Dungeone Master = Game Master

- As a DM, I can Invite subscribed users
- As a subscribed user, I can join a game 
- As a user with a player, i can give the player to another user
